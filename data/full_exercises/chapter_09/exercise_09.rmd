## Introduction

The goals of this exercise are to:
- Perform time-calibrated phylogenetic inference using revbayes


[RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io) is a very flexible tool for phylogenetic analyses. You have extensive control over which features of your model are constant, deterministic, or stochastic. This allows RevBayes to do a standard Bayesian phylogenetic inference, but it can also do much more including time calibration, ancestral character state reconstruction, and phylogenetic comparative analyses. 

This flexibility comes with greater complexity than many other tools. For example, the models are explicitly specified rather than just called by name (eg GTR). These configurations are far too extensive to list at the command line when you call the program, as we did for seqgen and iqtree. Instead, they are placed in RevBayes script files that typically end with the file extension `.Rev`. These files contain a series of command written in RevBayes' own language, which has a  [syntax](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/intro/rev.html) similar to R. For an introduction on how to specify models and implement analyses see the documentation on  [Getting Started with RevBayes tutorial](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/intro/getting_started.html). For an overview of all the commands see the [documentation](https://revbayes.github.io/documentation/).


A typical RevBayes script has commands that load the data, set up the model, define the analysis, run the analysis, and control what is in the output and where it goes. For routine analyses you can modify the basics of existing files, changing the input and output files for example. For more more specialized analyses you can extensively revise and expand these files, or write them from scrap.

There is a series of detailed [tutorials](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/) that serve as a great starting point for using RevBayes. This exercise is based off of the [Nucleotide substitution models](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/ctmc/) tutorial. There are a few variations to get it running on the cluster. 


## Getting set up

We are going to use a third party tool, [FigTree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases), to view the phylogenies.

Please also install [Tracer]( https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases/tag/v1.7.1), a tool for examining posterior distributions

You may need to also install [java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html) to get FigTree and Tracer running. 

## Getting the files

This exercise follows another existing tutorial -- [Molecular dating](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/dating/) by Rachel Warnock, Sebastian Höhna, Tracy Heath, April Wright and Walker Pett. That tutorial is split into 5 parts, each of which they refer to as an exercise. We will work through the first 4.

Rather than have everyone retype all the exercises, I provide all the job and script files that are needed.

There will be a few folders in your exercise directory:

- The job files for Grace
- `scripts` directory, with all the RevBayes scripts. These are called form the job files.
- `data` the input data
- `output` the results generated by RevBayes. It will create the folder if it doesn't already exist.

## Your tasks

Each [exercise](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/dating/) is broken into two parts - the top part explains how to type things in and run the analyses, and then a final section called `Examining the output` discusses the results.

Here is what you will do for each of the first 4 exercises:
1. Read through the top part, referring to the files in `scripts/`, to get a general idea of the goal and how it is accomplished.
2. Carefully walk through all the steps in `Examining the output`, using Tracer, FigTree, and the other indicated tools to explore and examine the results.
3. Answer the prompts below.

### 1. Molecular dating, The global molecular clock model

Here, they used molecular sequence data to infer relative speciation assuming global clock model. This global clock model assumes the rate of substitution is constant over time and across the tree.

> **_Problem 1:_** (2 points) 

1. Open up the bears_global.log file in Tracer (use File > Import Trace File...). Select the `speciation_rate` trace in the lower left pane. Inspect the posterior samples for `speciation_rate` with the Estimates, Marginal Density, and Trace views in the upper right. Answer the following questions.

- What was the estimated (mean) value?

A: The estimated (mean) value was 0.1182.

- What was the expected prior distribution on this value? How does the posterior distribution compare to that?

A: According to the tutorial and the tree_BD.Rev script, the expected prior distribution on this value was an exponential distribution rate of δ = 10. The expected value/mean of an exponential distribution with δ=10 is 0.1, which is very similar to the posterior distribution's value of 0.1182. The posterior distribution also appears to be an exponential distribution, so they are very similar despite the slightly different rate.

- Does the trace view suggest that the MCMC was well mixed?

A: Yes, the trace view suggests that the MCMC was well mixed because the chain does not stay in the same state for too long and neither does it jump around too much with consecutive steps in any one direction. Instead, the trace view appears to center around a mean value and the chain consistently moves around that mean value, which is a sign of good mixing.

2. Open up the bears_global.mcc.tre file in FigTree and make sure you can see the Node Labels, and that Node Ages are selected is the node labels. How would you interpret these numbers?

A: The analysis did not contain temporal information from the fossil record; instead, it fixed the root age to an arbitrary value of 1. Thus the units of the scale bar are arbitrary. We can interpret the node ages only as relative speciation times.

### 2. Molecular dating, The uncorrelated exponential relaxed clock model

> **_Problem 1:_** (2 points) 

1. Open up the bears_relaxed_exponential.log in Tracer. In the `Traces:` window on the lower left you can see all the rates estimates for the branch-specific rates. They are labeled `branch_rates[]`, with one for each branch.

- Take a look at the mean for each `branch_rates[]` value. How different are these?

A: The means range from around 0.1 to around 0.4, so they are quite different.

- What does this suggest about the global clock we used in the previous analysis?

A: This suggests that the global clock we used in the previous analysis was too restrictive, as it assumed that the rate of substitution was constant over time and across the tree. The relaxed clock model allows for the rate of substitution to vary across the tree, and the means of the branch-specific rates show that the rate of substitution does vary across the tree.


2. Open up the bears_relaxed_exponential.mcc.tre file in FigTree and make sure you can see the Node Labels. What is different about this tree compared to the global tree in terms of topology, node labels, and branch labels. Why did changing the model make these differences?

A: This tree is different from the global tree in that it is rooted differently with Ailuropoda melanoleuca as an outgroup, and it places Melursus ursinus differently within the topology. The node labels are also different, and in most places down the tree, the node ages are lower. The branch lengths are also different, and in most places down the tree, shorter. Changing the model made these differences because the relaxed clock model allows for the rate of substitution to vary across the tree. Thus, the relaxed clock model is more accurate than the global clock model, and the more parsimonious tree, with higher likelihood and posteriors, reflects this.
