Random number generator seed: -6784359269123580248

Simulations of 11 taxa, 40 nucleotides
  for 1 tree(s) with 1 dataset(s) per tree

Branch lengths of trees multiplied by 0.001

Rate homogeneity of sites.
Model = GTR: General time reversible (nucleotides)
  Rate of transitions and transversions equal:
  rate matrix = gamma1: 1.0000 alpha1: 4.0000  beta1: 1.0000
                                beta2: 1.0000 alpha2: 4.0000
                                              gamma2:  1.0000
  with nucleotide frequencies specified as:
  A=0.295 C=0.205 G=0.205 T=0.295
