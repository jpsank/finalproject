# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This is a stub for your final project. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

There are two ways you can use this document:  
- You can download this file to a folder on your computer, edit this document and add other files (data, code, etc), and then zip up and submit the folder on canvas.
- You can for the [repository](finalproject) containing this document on gitub. Then commit and push your canges to the repository, and submit a link to the repository on canvas.

Github is a great way to work on projects, but also has a steep initial learning curve.


Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

OK, here we go.

# Genetic Algorithms for Phylogenetic Inference (GAPI)

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to answer the question, How can genetic algorithms, inspired by the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm, be developed to enhance the efficiency or effectiveness of phylogenetic tree search?

The methods I will use to do this are: Python or C code to write the genetic algorithm, plus standard phylogenetic inference tools like IQ-TREE for comparison.

The data I will use are: Data will be taken from public datasets like the algae protein-coding genes from the Harnessing Machine Learning paper.

## Methods

The tools I used were... See analysis files at (links to analysis files).

## Results

## Discussion

The biggest difficulty in implementing these analyses was...

If I did these analyses again, I would...
